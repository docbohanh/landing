              <h2>Our story</h2>
              <p>We believe in stories. We love to discover unique ones and we are more than eager to help others build some nice stories of their own.<br />
              Why? Because we have our strong story behind these past ten years and all the knowledge that came with it.</p>
              <p>Everything began with a personal story. Bogdan Herea was born in Romania, but his results in school brought him a scholarship at INSA LYON (L’Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Lyon) where he studied Computer Engineering. After living and working for 13 years in France, he knew he must come back to Romania. His belief in the power of technology and the development of the IT industry made him start his first entrepreneurial projects.</p>
              <p>This is how PitechPlus started in 2006, as an IT services company in Cluj-Napoca, Romania.</p>
